1st argument is called music_directory and is required and is the directory to which you want to run the script on. 
2nd argument is called prepend_pl_name and is a string of characters that you will prepend the name with. This argument is not required and if no argument is provided the script can ignore this functionality.

Initializes a COM object to interact with iTunes.
Retrieves the subdirectories of the input directory.
For each subdirectory, it checks if a playlist with the same name already exists in iTunes. If not, it creates a new playlist named after the prepend_pl_name argument if provided and the folder name.
For each subdirectory, retrieve the subdirectories again and do the same. Do this for a max 4 levels of directories.
The AddSongsToPlaylist function is called for each subdirectory to add the songs to the corresponding playlists.

The AddSongsToPlaylist function does the following:
Retrieves all the .mp3 and .m4a files from the input folder (recursively).
For each song file, it checks if the song is already in the playlist by comparing the file path.
If the song is not in the playlist, it adds the song to the playlist.
